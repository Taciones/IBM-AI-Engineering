In order to provide estimate for classification, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the <b>most probable class</b> for that data point. For this, we use <b>Logistic Regression</b>.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-success alertsuccess\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n<font size=\"3\"><strong>Recall linear regression:</strong></font>\n<br>\n<br>\nLinear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, <i>y</i>, to some predictors (independent variables <i>x1</i>, <i>x2</i>, etc.). Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n<br><br>\n$$\ny = w0 + w1 \\times x1 + w2 \\times x2 + \\cdots\n$$\n<br>\nand finds the values of <i>w0</i>, <i>w1</i>, <i>w2</i>, etc. The term <i>w0</i> is the \"intercept\" or \"constant term\" (it's shown as <i>b</i> in the formula below):\n<br><br>\n$$\nY = W X + b\n$$\n<p></p>\n\n</div>\n\nLogistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, <i>y</i>, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n\nDespite the name logistic <i>regression</i>, it is actually a <b>probabilistic classification</b> model. Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function:\n\n$$\nProbabilityOfaClass = \\theta(y) = \\frac{e^y}{1 + e^y} = exp(y) / (1 + exp(y)) = p \n$$\n\nwhich produces p-values between 0 (as y approaches minus infinity $-\\infty$) and 1 (as y approaches plus infinity $+\\infty$). This now becomes a special kind of non-linear regression.\n\nIn this equation, <i>y</i> is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), <code>exp</code> is the exponential function and $\\theta(y)$ is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function\">logistic function</a>, also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve), and was first developed for modeling population growth.\n\nYou might also have seen this function before, in another configuration:\n\n$$\nProbabilityOfaClass = \\theta(y) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-y}}\n$$\n\nSo, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid function but then treats the result as a probability:\n\n<img src=\"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/kgv9alcghmjcv97op4d6onkyxevk23b1.png\" width=\"400\" align=\"center\">\n"
